## 🎨 Voice & Tone Guidelines

### Brand Voice
- **Professional but approachable** - Not corporate, not casual
- **Results-focused** - Lead with outcomes, not features
- **Local** - Always mention Seattle/cities
- **Specific** - "Fast restaurant websites" not just "websites"

### Words to Use
✅ Build, run, increase, turn, scale  
✅ Fast, reliable, proven, measurable  
✅ Orders, reservations, calls, visits  
✅ Seattle area, Greater Seattle, [specific cities]  

### Words to Avoid
❌ Innovative, cutting-edge, synergy, leverage  
❌ Best, #1, top, leading (without proof)  
❌ We help, we assist (too passive)  
❌ Solutions, platform, ecosystem (too vague)
