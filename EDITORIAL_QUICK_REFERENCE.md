## ❌ Words to Avoid

**Buzzwords:**  
✗ Innovative, cutting-edge, synergy, leverage, ecosystem  
✗ Solutions, platform, revolutionary, best-in-class

**Passive Voice:**  
✗ "Can be increased" → ✓ "We increase"  
✗ "Is optimized" → ✓ "We optimize"  
✗ "Are managed" → ✓ "We manage"

**Vague Claims:**  
✗ "Improve performance" → ✓ "Increase orders by 30%"  
✗ "Enhance visibility" → ✓ "Rank in top 3"  
✗ "Drive engagement" → ✓ "Get 50+ calls/month"

---

## 📐 Numbers & Formatting

- Use numerals: "5" not "five"
- Use % symbol: "30%" not "thirty percent"
- Use decimals: "2.5s" not "two and a half seconds"
- Use commas in thousands: "1,200" not "1200"
- Bold key stats: **30% increase** in orders

---

## 🎨 Brand Voice Reminders

**Think:** Experienced friend, not corporate consultant

**Sound like:** "We've helped 65+ restaurants scale. Here's how."  
**Don't sound like:** "Dineably Inc. provides comprehensive solutions..."

**Tone by Page:**
- Homepage: Confident, results-focused
- Services: Educational, specific
- Case Studies: Data-driven, credible
- FAQ: Helpful, direct

---

## 🔍 Self-Edit Test

1. **Read aloud** - Natural?
2. **Cut 20%** - Can you say it shorter?
3. **Scan test** - Main points clear in 10 seconds?
4. **Mom test** - Would your mom understand it?
5. **Action test** - What should reader do next?
