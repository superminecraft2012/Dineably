# Editorial Style Guide for Dineably

**Last Updated:** November 5, 2025  
**Applies To:** All website copy, blog posts, client communications, and marketing materials

## 📏 5 Core Editorial Rules

### Rule 1: Keep Paragraphs ≤3 Lines, Bullets Over Blocks

**Why:** Improves scannability and mobile readability. Users don't read—they scan.

**✅ Good Example:**
```
We increase your restaurant's online orders through three channels: fast websites 
that convert visitors, local SEO that ranks you in "near me" searches, and targeted 
ads that bring hungry customers to your door.

Key deliverables:
• Mobile-first website (under 2.5s load time)
• Google Business Profile optimization
• Call tracking by source
```

**❌ Bad Example:**
```
Our comprehensive restaurant marketing solution leverages cutting-edge technology 
and proven methodologies to optimize your digital presence across multiple channels, 
including but not limited to website development, search engine optimization, paid 
advertising campaigns, social media management, and reputation monitoring. We work 
collaboratively with you to understand your unique business needs and craft a 
customized strategy that aligns with your goals and budget constraints while 
maximizing return on investment through data-driven decision making and continuous 
optimization of all campaign elements.
```

**Action:** Break long paragraphs into 3-line chunks. Use bullet lists for 3+ items.

---

### Rule 2: Lead with Outcomes; Back with One Stat

**Why:** Clients care about results, not features. Stats add credibility.

**✅ Good Example:**
```
Increase order-online clicks by 30%+
We optimize your website's call-to-action buttons, menu layout, and checkout flow. 
Our clients see a median 30% rise in order clicks within 90 days.
```

**❌ Bad Example:**
```
Our proprietary CRO framework includes A/B testing, heatmap analysis, and user journey 
optimization to improve your website's conversion funnel efficiency.
```

**Formula:**
```
[Outcome/Benefit] + [One supporting stat]
[Brief explanation of how]
```

**Examples:**
- "Rank in the top 3 for 'thai restaurant [city]'. We optimize your Google Business Profile and build local citations. Average ranking improvement: position 12 to position 3 in 60 days."
- "Cut your cost-per-click by 20%. We use dayparting and geo-targeting to show ads only when hungry customers search. Typical savings: $240/month on a $1,200 budget."

---

### Rule 3: Avoid Jargon; Define Terms In-Line

**Why:** Not everyone knows marketing terminology. Define terms without breaking flow.

**✅ Good Example:**
```
We optimize your GBP (Google Business Profile)—the box that appears when 
someone searches for your restaurant on Google Maps.
```

**❌ Bad Example:**
```
We leverage schema markup, meta tags, and canonical URLs to improve your 
SERP CTR through rich snippet optimization.
```

**Common Terms to Define:**

| Jargon | In-Line Definition |
|--------|-------------------|
| SEO | "SEO (getting your restaurant to rank on Google)" |
| GBP | "GBP (Google Business Profile)—your restaurant's info box on Google Maps" |
| CRO | "CRO (conversion rate optimization)—making more visitors take action" |
| PPC | "PPC (pay-per-click ads)—Google Ads and Facebook Ads" |
| CTR | "click-through rate (how often people click your link)" |
| UTM | "UTM tags (tracking codes that show which ad brought a customer)" |
| Dayparting | "dayparting (showing ads only during lunch and dinner)" |

**Action:** On first mention of any technical term, add a brief in-line definition in parentheses.

---

### Rule 4: Use Active Voice and Action Verbs

**Why:** Active voice is direct, clear, and feels more confident. Action verbs create momentum.

**✅ Good Examples:**
```
• "Increase orders"
• "Rank in 'near me' searches"
• "Cut your ad spend"
• "Turn visits into reservations"
• "Build a fast website"
```

**❌ Bad Examples:**
```
• "Orders can be increased"
• "Rankings are improved"
• "Ad spend is reduced"
• "Conversions are optimized"
• "A website is built"
```

**Action Verb Library:**

| Category | Strong Verbs |
|----------|-------------|
| **Results** | Increase, grow, boost, double, generate |
| **Rankings** | Rank, dominate, claim, own, appear |
| **Cost/Efficiency** | Cut, reduce, save, lower, optimize |
| **Conversion** | Turn, convert, transform, drive, capture |
| **Building** | Build, create, design, launch, deploy |
| **SEO/Visibility** | Show up, appear, rank, dominate, claim |
| **Analytics** | Track, measure, monitor, analyze, report |

**Passive Voice Checker:**
If you can add "by zombies" to the end of the sentence and it makes sense, it's passive.
- "Orders are increased by zombies" ❌ (passive)
- "We increase orders by zombies" ✅ (active, but weird)

---

### Rule 5: Every Page Ends with a Single Primary CTA

**Why:** Too many choices = no choice. One clear next step drives action.

**✅ Good Example:**
```
Ready to Scale Your Restaurant?
Book your free 15-minute audit and we'll show you exactly where you're 
losing orders—and how to fix it.

[Book Your Free Audit] ← Single, prominent button
```

**❌ Bad Example:**
```
Learn more about our services, download our free guide, schedule a call, 
read our blog, follow us on social media, or contact us for more information.

[Learn More] [Download] [Schedule] [Blog] [Follow] [Contact]
```

**CTA Guidelines:**
- **One CTA per page** (primary action)
- **Action-oriented button text** ("Book Audit", "See Results", "Get Started")
- **Value in headline** ("Ready to Scale..." "See Real Results..." "Stop Losing Orders...")
- **Brief explanation** (1-2 lines max)
- **No secondary CTAs** in the same section (move them up the page)

**Standard CTAs by Page:**

| Page | Primary CTA |
|------|------------|
| Home | "Book Your Free 15-Minute Audit" |
| Services | "Book Your Free Audit" |
| Why Us | "Ready to Scale Your Restaurant?" |
| Process | "Ready to Get Started?" |
| Case Studies | "Get Results Like These" |
| FAQ | "Book Your Free Audit" |
| City Pages | "Serving [City] Restaurants" → "Book Audit" |

❌ "Drive engagement" → ✅ "Get 50+ calls per month"

## 📐 Formatting Standards

- **H3:** Subsections, can be questions

**Examples:**
- H1: "Restaurant Marketing Services" ✅
- H2: "Increase Orders with Fast Websites" ✅ (outcome-focused)
- H2: "About Our Process" ❌ (vague)

### Lists
- **Use bullets** for unordered items
- **Use numbers** only for sequential steps
- **Keep list items parallel** (all start with verbs or all start with nouns)

**Good:**
```
• Build your website
• Optimize your Google profile
• Launch your ad campaigns
```

**Bad (not parallel):**
```
• Website building
• We optimize your Google profile
• Launch ad campaigns
```

### Emphasis
- **Bold** key outcomes and stats
- *Italics* for terms being defined
- `Code format` only for actual code or technical strings

### Numbers
- **Use numerals** for all numbers (not "five", use "5")
- **Use %** symbol (not "percent")
- **Use decimals** for precision ("2.5s" not "two and a half seconds")
- **Use commas** for thousands ("1,200" not "1200")

## 🎨 Voice & Tone

### Brand Voice: Professional + Approachable
**Think:** Experienced friend who knows the industry, not corporate consultant or casual buddy.

**✅ Sounds like:**
```
"We've helped 65+ restaurants scale their online orders. Here's how we do it."
```

**❌ Doesn't sound like:**
```
Corporate: "Dineably Inc. provides comprehensive digital marketing solutions..."
Too casual: "Hey there! We're super stoked to help ya grow your restaurant! 🎉"
```

### Tone by Content Type

| Content Type | Tone | Example |
|-------------|------|---------|
| Homepage | Confident, results-focused | "Increase orders by 30%+ in 90 days" |
| Services | Educational, specific | "We optimize your Google Business Profile—the box that shows up on Google Maps" |
| Case Studies | Data-driven, credible | "320% increase in order-online clicks in 90 days" |
| FAQ | Helpful, direct | "How long until I see results? Most clients see measurable improvements in 30-45 days." |
| Blog | Informative, actionable | "Follow these 5 steps to optimize your Google Business Profile" |
